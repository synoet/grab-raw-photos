# grab-raw-photos

When you have a folder containing both JPG/JPEG and RAW format photos, you first send the JPG/JPEG images to someone for selection. After they make their choices, they return a folder containing the selected JPG/JPEG images. This matches these selected JPG/JPEG images with their corresponding RAW files in your original folder to a new output folder
